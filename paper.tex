(\textit{OBDDs}). It provides an overview of the representation of OBDDs, the

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

In computer-aided design (CAD) as well as other domains like artificial
intelligence or combinatorics, many problems can be formulated as Boolean
functions. These Boolean functions then can be represented symbolically using the
\textit{Binary Decision Diagrams} (\textit{BDDs}) introduced by Lee\cite{LEE59}
and Akers\cite{AKERS78} in 1959 and 1978, respectively.

In 1986 Bryant\cite{BRYANT86} published a paper of high impact, describing a
\textit{reduced} and \textit{ordered} class of BDDs, so-called \textit{ROBDDs}
(\textit{Reduced Ordered} BDDs) but in literature mostly referred to as
\textit{OBDDs}. OBDDs represent Boolean functions in a \textit{canonical}
form. This results in a compact form and very efficient tests for some properties,
e.g. satisfiability or equivalence\cite{BRYANT86}.

Bryant also introduced and experimentally evaluated efficient implementation
techniques for OBDDs in collaboration with Brace and
Rudell~\cite{BRACE90, BRYANT92}.

Already in the inital paper describing OBDDs, the importance of the variable
ordering was highlighted. Only if the variable ordering is chosen properly, it
will result in a small graph (OBDD) and, in turn, in more efficient testing.

Nonetheless representing Boolean functions using OBDDs has some drawbacks. Classes
of Boolean functions exist for which the size of the graph grows exponentially
independent of the variable ordering, e.g. integer
multiplication~\cite{BRYANT86, BRYANT91, WOELFEL01}.

These limitations of OBDDs motivated researchers to introduce heuristics and
other techniques like \textit{dynamic variable ordering}~\cite{RUDELL93} to solve
the problem of variable ordering~\cite{BOLLIG96}. Furthermore, alternative
representations which e.g. relax the ordering~\cite{BRYANT95} or change the
interpretation of nodes~\cite{BRYANT95, ANDERSEN97} were developed. Such
representations may be beneficial for some classes of Boolean functions but mostly
suffer from losing the canonical form and hence the desirable properties OBDDs
are famous for.

This paper serves as survey on symbolic Boolean function manipulation using OBDDs.
The following section describes the representation of Boolean functions through
BDDs as well as OBDDs. It also highlights the advantages and disadvantages of the
OBDD representation. The third section describes operations which can be applied
to OBDDs efficiently. No source code is provided but those can be looked up in
the corresponding papers easily (references are provided for each algorithm).
Section~\ref{sec:implementation-aspects} describes aspects one has to take into
account when implementing an OBDD package, such as what data structures to use
or how to deal with the problem of variable ordering. Limitations of the OBDD
representation are described in the subsequent section. The last section
discusses alternative representations to possibly overcome the limitations of
the OBDD representation. \tbr

\section{Representation Basics}
\label{sec:representation-basics}

\textit{Binary decision diagrams} (\textit{BDDs}) have been well studied since
Lee~\cite{LEE59} and especially Akers~\cite{AKERS78} introduced them. BDDs
represent a Boolean function $f$ as an acyclic, directed graph (DAG). Nodes
represent variables and have one incoming and two outgoing edges, each of which
denotes the variable evaluates to 0 (left) or 1 (right), respectively. Whenever
the result of $f$ is fixed, an edge points to one of the constant functions
\textbf{0} or \textbf{1}. To evaluate $f$ for a given variable assignment, one
just follows the path for the respective variable values. As soon as the path
ends up in a constant, i.e. \textbf{0} or \textbf{1}, this is the result of the
corresponding variable assignment. Akers~\cite{AKERS78} already provided some
techniques to simplify the BDD representation such as combining equivalent nodes.

Figure~\ref{fig:bdd} shows an example of a BDD representing the Boolean function
$f=(A \land B) \lor (B \land C)$. To simplify the graphs, the diagram style of
Bryant~\cite{BRYANT92} is reused, i.e. edge labels are skipped. Instead dashed
and solid lines are used to represent the value of the decision variable to be 0
and 1, respectively. This diagram style is used throughout this paper.

        \label{fig:obdd}
    }
    \caption{BDD and OBDD of $f=(A \land B) \lor (B \land C)$.}
\end{figure}

However, Bryant~\cite{BRYANT86} introduced some restrictions concerning the
ordering of the so-called \textit{decision variables} represented by the nodes
of the BDD. Furthermore, Bryant\cite{BRYANT86} was able to derive a reduced
representation of BDDs providing the DAG in a canonical form: the
\textit{Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagram} (\textit{ROBDD}; mostly referred
to as \textit{OBDD}, even by Bryant himself). In this paper, the terms ROBDD and
OBDD are used synonymously.

Figure~\ref{fig:obdd} shows one possible ROBDD representation of
$f$. The following section covers the details of how
to derive the OBDD representation from a BDD. \tbr

\subsection{From BDDs to OBDDs}
\label{subsec:from-bdds-to-obdds}

As the name suggests, \textit{Reduced} Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams are a 
minimized representation of BDDs. Furthermore, the decision variables are ordered
consistently. More formally, for any node $\upsilon$ and their respective children
$\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$, a total ordering is imposed, i.e.
$var(\upsilon) < var(\omega_1)$ and $var(\upsilon) < var(\omega_2)$, respectively,
where $var(x)$ denotes the label of node $x$~\cite{BRYANT86, BRYANT92}.

This \textit{variable ordering} affects the efficiency of the symbolic
manipulation because different variable orderings, in general, produce different
OBDDs. In the worst case, this will result in exponential complexity for bad
orderings. Nevertheless, as will be described in Section~\ref{sec:limitations},
there exist classes of functions for which the OBDD complexity is exponential
regardless of which variable ordering is chosen.

Before discussing the reduction procedure, some definitions are necessary. Here
the original definitions of Bryant~\cite{BRYANT86, BRYANT91} are reused.

A Boolean function can be represented as an OBDD, i.e. a rooted, directed,
acyclic graph (DAG) with a set of nodes $V$ as well as a set of edges $E$. 

There exist \textit{nonterminal} and \textit{terminal} nodes. Each
\textit{nonterminal} node $n$ has its own label $var(n)$ as well as two edges,
connecting it to its left $lo(n)\in V$ and right child $hi(n)\in V$, respectively. 
Each \textit{terminal} node $t$ has a unique value $value(t)$, i.e. $value(t)$
is a constant function (for Boolean functions \textbf{0} or \textbf{1}). Hence,
for each constant function only a single terminal node exists.

The following property has to hold for any nonterminal node $n$ in order to
satisfy the ordering requirement of an OBDD:
$var(n) < var(lo(n)) \land var(n) < var(hi(n))$.
In other words, for any path starting at the root of an OBDD, if a path is
followed until a terminal node is reached, the nonterminal nodes are traversed
strictly in the variable ordering.

\paragraph*{Reduction procedure}
\mbox{} % workaround to get line break after paragraph

Bryant~\cite{BRYANT86, BRYANT92} described three transformation rules to reduce
a graph such that it still represents the same function as before.

For each constant function, there exists only a single terminal node representing
it, e.g. for Boolean functions, only two terminal nodes exist, representing
\textbf{0} and \textbf{1}, respectively. Hence, when transforming a given BDD,
eliminate all but one terminal node for each constant function and redirect all
edges accordingly, i.e. to the one remaining node for each constant function.

There may be duplicate nonterminal nodes present in a given BDD. Formally, a node
$d$ is a duplicate if $var(d) = var(n) \land lo(d) = lo(n) \land hi(d) = hi(n)$
holds for any other node $n$. If this is the case, $d$ can be eliminated and all
edges are redirected to $n$.

The third and last transformation rule deals with completely redundant nonterminal
nodes. Intuitively, this rule should be straightforward: any node having the same
child on all outgoing edges is redundant because the actual value of the variable
does not change the result of the function. More formally, a nonterminal node $n$
is redundant if $lo(n) = hi(n)$. Then, all incoming edges of $n$ can be redirected
to $lo(n)$ and $n$ can be deleted afterwards.

This paper serves as a survey on \textit{ordered binary Decision diagrams}
(\textit{OBDDs}). It provides an overview of the representation of OBDDs, the
operations which can be applied efficiently, some aspects when implementing them
as well as their limitations and how to probably overcome them by using
alternative representations. No new results or insights are provided. \tbr

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

In computer-aided design (CAD) as well as other domains like artificial
intelligence or combinatorics, many problems can be formulated as Boolean
functions. These Boolean functions then can be represented symbolically using the
\textit{Binary Decision Diagrams} (\textit{BDDs}) introduced by Lee\cite{LEE59}
and Akers\cite{AKERS78} in 1959 and 1978, respectively.

In 1986 Bryant\cite{BRYANT86} published a paper of high impact, describing a
\textit{reduced} and \textit{ordered} class of BDDs, so-called \textit{ROBDDs}
(\textit{Reduced Ordered} BDDs) but in literature mostly referred to as
\textit{OBDDs}. OBDDs represent Boolean functions in a \textit{canonical}
form. This results in a compact form and very efficient tests for some properties,
e.g. satisfiability or equivalence\cite{BRYANT86}.

Bryant also introduced and experimentally evaluated efficient implementation
techniques for OBDDs in collaboration with Brace and
Rudell~\cite{BRACE90, BRYANT92}.

Already in the inital paper describing OBDDs, the importance of the variable
ordering was highlighted. Only if the variable ordering is chosen properly, it
will result in a small graph (OBDD) and, in turn, in more efficient testing.

Nonetheless representing Boolean functions using OBDDs has some drawbacks. Classes
of Boolean functions exist for which the size of the graph grows exponentially
independent of the variable ordering, e.g. integer
multiplication~\cite{BRYANT86, BRYANT91, WOELFEL01}.

These limitations of OBDDs motivated researchers to introduce heuristics and
other techniques like \textit{dynamic variable ordering}~\cite{RUDELL93} to solve
the problem of variable ordering~\cite{BOLLIG96}. Furthermore, alternative
representations which e.g. relax the ordering~\cite{BRYANT95} or change the
interpretation of nodes~\cite{BRYANT95, ANDERSEN97} were developed. Such
representations may be beneficial for some classes of Boolean functions but mostly
suffer from losing the canonical form and hence the desirable properties OBDDs
are famous for.

This paper serves as survey on symbolic Boolean function manipulation using OBDDs.
The following section describes the representation of Boolean functions through
BDDs as well as OBDDs. It also highlights the advantages and disadvantages of the
OBDD representation. The third section describes operations which can be applied
to OBDDs efficiently. No source code is provided but those can be looked up in
the corresponding papers easily (references are provided for each algorithm).
Section~\ref{sec:implementation-aspects} describes aspects one has to take into
account when implementing an OBDD package, such as what data structures to use
or how to deal with the problem of variable ordering. Limitations of the OBDD
representation are described in the subsequent section. The last section
discusses alternative representations to possibly overcome the limitations of
the OBDD representation. \tbr

\section{Representation Basics}
\label{sec:representation-basics}

\textit{Binary decision diagrams} (\textit{BDDs}) have been well studied since
Lee~\cite{LEE59} and especially Akers~\cite{AKERS78} introduced them. BDDs
represent a Boolean function $f$ as an acyclic, directed graph (DAG). Nodes
represent variables and have one incoming and two outgoing edges, each of which
denotes the variable evaluates to 0 (left) or 1 (right), respectively. Whenever
the result of $f$ is fixed, an edge points to one of the constant functions
\textbf{0} or \textbf{1}. To evaluate $f$ for a given variable assignment, one
just follows the path for the respective variable values. As soon as the path
ends up in a constant, i.e. \textbf{0} or \textbf{1}, this is the result of the
corresponding variable assignment. Akers~\cite{AKERS78} already provided some
techniques to simplify the BDD representation such as combining equivalent nodes.

Figure~\ref{fig:bdd} shows an example of a BDD representing the Boolean function
$f=(A \land B) \lor (B \land C)$. To simplify the graphs, the diagram style of
Bryant~\cite{BRYANT92} is reused, i.e. edge labels are skipped. Instead dashed
and solid lines are used to represent the value of the decision variable to be 0
and 1, respectively. This diagram style is used throughout this paper.

        \label{fig:obdd}
    }
    \caption{BDD and OBDD of $f=(A \land B) \lor (B \land C)$.}
\end{figure}

However, Bryant~\cite{BRYANT86} introduced some restrictions concerning the
ordering of the so-called \textit{decision variables} represented by the nodes
of the BDD. Furthermore, Bryant\cite{BRYANT86} was able to derive a reduced
representation of BDDs providing the DAG in a canonical form: the
\textit{Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagram} (\textit{ROBDD}; mostly referred
to as \textit{OBDD}, even by Bryant himself). The following section covers the
details of the OBDD representation. \tbr
